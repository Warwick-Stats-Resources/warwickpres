# warwickpres format

*Currently a work-in-progress, not quite ready for general use.*

This is a Quarto presentation format that is consistent with The University of Warwick's [ID7 branding](https://id7.warwick.ac.uk) (especially [colours](https://id7.warwick.ac.uk/components/colour-palette/) and [font](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/its/servicessupport/web/sitebuilder2/id7/faqs/fonts/)).

## Installing

```bash
quarto use template Warwick-Stats-Resources/warwickpres
```

This will install the extension and create an example qmd file that you can use as a starting place for your article.

## Using

*TODO*: Describe how to use your format.

## Format Options

*TODO*: If your format has options that can be set via document metadata, describe them.

## Example

Here is the source code for a minimal sample document: [template.qmd](template.qmd).
